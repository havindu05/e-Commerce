        Badminton-shop is one of the leading retailers in Europe for badminton equipment. We have curated the best
        selection from highly respected brands such as Yonex, Forza, Victor, Li-Ning, RSL, and many more.

        We are the place where you can find everything for the badminton player, whether you are a beginner,
        recreational player, or tournament competitor.

        We strive to always have the coolest badminton goods in stock, so you can receive them quickly and at a
        competitive price. Additionally, we are first with the latest releases, ensuring you find all the new arrivals
        right here, first.

        For us, good service means accessibility and expert advice. We are always just an email away, so feel free to
        reach out if you need assistance or guidance regarding our products.

        The company is owned by Mikkel Normann & Torben van den Brekel Kulmbak, who themselves have years of experience
        in high-level badminton. Along with over 20 full-time employees, we ship products across Europe from our large
        warehouse in Odense, Denmark.<br>

        In 2010, Torben van den Brekel Kulmbak acquires “Badmintonshoppen.dk” and relocates everything to Frederiksberg
        in Denmark, where operations are conducted from a third-floor apartment. Torben has a deep passion for badminton
        and a keen interest in the developments in e-commerce. Moreover, Torben has been playing badminton since
        childhood, progressing through various levels from the Ligaen to Denmarksserien, primarily representing Værløse
        badminton. With over 25 years of experience in badminton, Torben brings the necessary expertise to provide the
        best possible customer advice.

    <div class="detailsBad2">
        As early as 2012, Torben has gained enough momentum to take the first critical step. It’s time to decide whether
        to commit full-time or continue as a hobby project. Torben chooses to go full-time with “Badmintonshoppen” and
        leaves his job to dedicate himself to the webshop.
        By that time, more brands had joined “Badmintonshoppen”, along with more customers, necessitating additional
        space. Therefore, the first warehouse space was rented at the same location in Frederiksberg.
        In August 2016, “Badmintonshoppen” acquires the racket sports store Ketshop in Funen, thereby adding a physical
        store and another webshop named Ketshop.dk. Everything is moved to Odense, where Ketshop was previously located.
        With two businesses under the same roof, development begins to accelerate at a high pace. At the same time,
        Torben meets Ketshop’s store manager, Mikkel Normann, who later goes on to play a significant role.
        That same year, the physical store and webshop also separate operations. The physical store retains its location
        with approximately 250 sqm of retail space and 350 sqm of warehouse space, while the webshop and its staff move
        to larger premises exceeding 1000 sqm. The company’s workforce has now grown to over 15 employees.
