# e-Commerce
This project is a basic e-commerce platform designed to give you practical experience in building an online store using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” without any backend or server-side database. Instead, it uses the browser's localStorage as a makeshift database to store user data, products, cart contents, and order information.
